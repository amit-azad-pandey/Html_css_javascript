        <p>In Html the content is displayed as it is given but when we want to show symbols that are considered as part of code we get 
            in trouble as the browser doesnt render that like to display (&lang;) we use <b>&amp;lang;</b> and to display (&amp;) we 
            use <b>&amp;amp;</b> and copyright is given by &copy;  trademark by &trade; and none <b>breackable&nbsp;space</b> as &amp;nbsp; 
            here breackable space is a single word and cant be broken by resizing browser. 
        </p>
        <!-- to show < we use &lang; and for > &rang; and to show 
            copyright symbol &copy; 
            trade mark symbol &trade;
            & &amp;
            and more are available in wikipedia so just go through them when needed-->
